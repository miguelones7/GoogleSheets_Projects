Hi! I made this project to control real students in my current job (aug 2025). 

All information are made up, I've just used the base sheet so you can see and learn about the codes!

Enjoy :) 


# --- How to use:
	
	Accessing the 'Management' tab, you can see how many active classes there are and its code.
	Copy the code and insert it at 'Class Code' next cell (G1).
		The students at this class will appear bellow. Copy a name and put it at 'Student Name'(J1).

	This way you can see the student informations and access informations. 


I made this project so I can manage all login/password informations and easily find it about various apps, sites
and programs used by students.
